                I’m a third-year Computer Engineering student pursuing my degree from Cummins
                College Of Engineering for Women, India. I have a strong foundation in programming and
                problem-solving, with proficiency in
                C, C++, Java, and JavaScript. I’m currently expanding my expertise in full-stack web development
                using Node.js, Express, and EJS, and I enjoy creating efficient and user-friendly applications
                that blend logic with creativity.

                My educational journey began at R.S. Mundle English School and Junior College, followed by my
                Higher Secondary Education from Tip Top Convent and Higher Secondary School. These institutions
                have built the discipline that continues to guide my
                professional growth.

                I’m passionate about continuous learning, exploring new technologies, and contributing to
                meaningful, real-world software solutions that make an impact.

                    Alongside academics, I actively participate in extracurricular activities, particularly in
                    sports. I secured the third position in the University Cricket Matches, and my team achieved the
                    second position in the Team Event of Cricket Matches organized by MKSSS, Pune.
                    These experiences taught me valuable lessons in teamwork, leadership, and consistency —
                    qualities I strive to carry into my technical career.
